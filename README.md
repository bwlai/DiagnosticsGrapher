# DiagnosticsGrapher

Simple application with specific use to graph diagnostics with properly formatted XML file.

Instructions for use:
----
1. Turn on the setting to write diagnostics to a XML file. Do what you want with the application, and close the application properly, if possible. 
2. Locate a diagnostics XML file under the Diagnostics folder. *Note:* If the application crashed in the run you want to diagnose, the XML file will not be complete and you will need to append "\</Root>" to the end of the file.
3. Open the diagnostics grapher. It will appear blank. Drag and drop the diagnostics XML file of your choosing to the blank space of the diagnostics grapher. If the XML file is large, it may take some time to parse. If nothing happens, then most likely the XML file is not properly formatted. 
4. Once the XML file is properly loaded, you should be able to open the drop-down list to select which graph you would like to view.
